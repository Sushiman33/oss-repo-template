* 10 criteria of Open Source Definition
  * All of these criteria are very important because without any one of these it will take away the openness that is open source software. For example, if there was no free distribution, access to source code, or no way of the updating/modifying the source code, the software in question would be no different than any other paid software. The rest of the criteria that followed these are only natural in order to keep everything open and accessable to everyone with no restrictions whatsoever. 
* Smart Questions - How to ask the question The Smart Way
  * There are many helpful tips for people in this article, most of the material though is only good for beginners or people who are not very familiar with the operations of the modern internet. For example, of your first instinct was to email the developer instead of googing the issue, you may not know stacked overflow exists. The tips that were useful like cutting down on the code required to show the bug, being explicit with what the error is, and listing all approaches taken to fix the error are very good and are useful for more than just asking programming help.

* Suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
  * Suggestion 1: If you do not know the answer but know someone who is more likely to know it, ask them to see if they can take a look at it
  * Suggestion 2: If you know what was done incorrecly, try and point it out so the person asking the question hopefully doesn't run into a similar situation with a different answer
* Chapter 3 of Free Culture
  * This chapter taught me a lot about RPI history, the early days of the internet/intranet search engines, and the fallacies of the United States legal system. To begin, as a current RPI student, it is weird to think of a time when Google was in it's relative infacncy and knowing that a student effectively made a search engine that was good for RPI's network. Looking at search engines in general, it's weird thinking of using something that isn't Google at this point since there really isn't anything on the RPI network that you can't access from the internet given that the RPI VPN is used when outside of campus. This then leads into the legal system being very messy and allowing things like a search engine, which does not dictate the contents that it accesses, to be subject to copyright laws. In general, I believe that unless the software or technologie in question is directly causing the issue, the people using the technology for these bad purposes are at fault. Blaming Jesse for being a pirate in this situation is like saying that the founders of Google are pirates. Both give access to files which are subject to copyright laws, but Jesse wasn't a large company and he was operating on the intranet. Also the numbers generated by all the lawsuits together show that the RIAA was most likely doing this to set a precident to take down Napster since there was no way 100 billion would just magically appear. Overall though I do not agree with how it was handeled since it was only one person, who never intended for his software to be used like that, used by a limited number of people over one containted network.
